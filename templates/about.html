      <h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The overall DETR architecture is surprisingly simple and depicted in Figure 1. It contains three main components, which we describe below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A CNN backbone to extract a compact feature representation</li>
        <li>An encoder-decoder transformer</li>
        <li>A simple feed forward network (FFN) that makes the final detection prediction</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Unlike many modern detectors, DETR can be implemented in any deep learning framework that provides a common CNN backbone and a transformer architecture implementation with just a few hundred lines. Inference code for DETR can be implemented in less than 50 lines in PyTorch.

      <h2>How DETR Works</h2>
      <p>
        DETR uses a conventional CNN backbone to learn a 2D representation of an input image. The model flattens it and supplements it with a positional encoding before passing it into a transformer encoder. A transformer decoder then takes as input a small fixed number of learned positional embeddings, which we call object queries, and additionally attends to the encoder output. We pass each output embedding of the decoder to a shared feed forward network (FFN) that predicts either a detection (class and bounding box) or a “no object” class.
